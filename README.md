# Access free real-time data from Argentina's capital market

Here, I demonstrate how to use the **Invertir Online (IOL) API** to access free historical and real-time data from Argentina's capital market. I also utilice  **Plotly** to create interactive visualizations that make the data easier to understand. If you're new to reporting or data visualization, you might find this especially useful.

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files, each showcasing different ways to utilize the IOL API:

## 1. Cotizaciones Hist√≥ricas
- Access historical data for specific companies and assets through the IOL API.
- Create engaging visualizations with Plotly to better analyze trends and patterns.

## 2. Portafolio
- Retrieve detailed information about your investment portfolio.
- Keep track of its composition and monitor your gains (or losses üôÅ).

## 3. Market Panels
- Obtain real-time data on a wide range of assets.
- Explore market panels grouped by relevant characteristics, such as Merval, sovereign bonds, dollar-linked bonds, and more.
