# Access Free Real-Time Data from Argentina's Capital Market

This repository demonstrates how to use the **Invertir Online (IOL) API** to access free historical and real-time data from Argentina's capital market. It also showcases the use of **Plotly** to create interactive visualizations that make the data easier to understand. If you're new to reporting or data visualization, this might be especially useful.

The repository includes three Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files, each highlighting a specific use case for the IOL API:

## 1. Cotizaciones Hist√≥ricas
- Access historical data for specific companies and assets using the IOL API.
- Create engaging visualizations with Plotly to analyze trends and patterns effectively.

## 2. Portafolio
- Retrieve detailed information about your investment portfolio.
- Track its composition and monitor your gains (or losses üôÅ).

## 3. Market Panels
- Obtain real-time data for a wide range of assets.
- Explore market panels grouped by relevant characteristics, such as Merval, sovereign bonds, dollar-linked bonds, and more.

## Additional Resource

This repository also includes a **PDF guide** designed for those who are just starting with programming. In this document, I explain in simple terms:
- What an API is and how it works.
- The thought process behind each of the three notebooks mentioned above.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and the guide to enhance your understanding.
